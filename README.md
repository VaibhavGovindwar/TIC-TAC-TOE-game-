# TIC-TAC-TOE-game-
TIC-TAC-TOE Game development in python language.
A Simple program which pretend to play TIC-TAC-TOE with the user and the computer

---------------------------------------------------------( GAME SCENARIO )----------------------------------------------

The computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using 'X'.
The user (e.g., you) should play the game using 'O'.
The first move belongs to the computer − it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board.
All the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1.
The user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied.
The program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins.
The computer responds with its move and the check is repeated.
Don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.
