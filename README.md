Tic-Tac-Toe Game: User vs. Computer
Project Overview
This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user competes against the computer. The computer always plays with 'X' and makes its first move in the center of the board. The user plays with 'O' and selects moves by inputting the square number (1-9). The game includes proper input validation and ensures fair play by avoiding occupied squares. After each move, the game checks for a winner, a tie, or continues until the board is full.

Features
Simple User Input: Players select their move by entering a number between 1 and 9.
Random Computer Moves: The computer selects its moves randomly after the initial center position.
Game Outcome Check: The game checks for a win, tie, or continuation after every move.
Error Handling: Ensures user input is valid and prevents overwriting occupied squares.
Game Rules
The computer always plays as 'X' and starts in the center.
The user plays as 'O' and chooses a move by selecting the corresponding square.
The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full (resulting in a tie).
The player or computer wins when they have three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
